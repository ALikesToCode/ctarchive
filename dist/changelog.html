          The current way off loading comments to a submission, stopped worked
          for newer submissions. I added an alternative way to load comments. If
          the old way finds no comments the Backup method will automatically
          jump in and should always be able to load the comments, if they exists
          within pushshift.
        </li>
        <li>
          This also fixed the issue of loading comments if a submission has more
          than 2000 comments. It will load around 1000 comments at a time and
          then wait 10 seconds.
