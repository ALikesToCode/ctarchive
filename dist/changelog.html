          In the prior changelog, I talked about two different ways of loading
          comments. The old method had had several issues, due to poor
          maintenance of the API Endpoint of pushshift. The issue that some
          comment threads won't load at all, was fixed in the last changelog.
          However, then another issue started showing up. To identify the
          responses for each comment, there is a "parent_id" field returned by
          the API for each comment. The old method of loading comments would
          receive the wrong parent_id for each comment. Instead of it being the
          proper base36 number, it would be the same number in base 10. This
          resulted in me not being able to assign a reply to its parent and the
          comments would be an "orphan". If a comment is orphaned(the parent
          cannot be found) this site will display it at the end and it would
          span the entire width of the site. Because of the failure of the old
          API Endpoint that I used, there was some(many) submission where this
          happened to every comment, making it pretty unreadable. This same
          issue does not exist within the new method of loading comments. I
          fixed this problem with the old method, but then realized that the old
          method would sometimes return comments in the wrong order (e.g. a
          child would appear before its parent) this would also result in
          orphaned comments. This again does not occur with the new method, and
          there would have been no easy fix for it. While ingesting the comments
          this tool heavily relies on receiving the parents before it receives
          the children. So I just decided to completely abandon the old method.
          Every search will now load the comments of submission using the new
          method.

        <li>
          Pushshift also changed how many comments/submission can be loaded at a
          time to 100 from 1000. So the size parameter will not work for values
          past 100.
        </li>
        <li>
          Changed how orphaned comments appear. They no longer take on the full
          width and now have a slightly darker gray background.
        </li>
        <li>
          Changed the color of highlighted comments to a less obnoxious green.
        </li>

      <ul>
        <li>The Size option works now. Range 1-1000</li>
        <li>
          The current way off loading comments to a submission, stopped working
          for newer submissions.
          <br />
          I added an alternative way to load comments. If the old way finds no
          comments the Backup method will automatically jump in <br/ > and
          should always be able to load the comments, if they exists within
          pushshift.
        </li>
        <li>
          This also fixed the issue of loading comments if a submission has more
          than 2000 comments. It will load around 1000 comments at a time and
          then wait 10 seconds.
        </li>
